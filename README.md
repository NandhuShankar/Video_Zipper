# Video_Zipper
Class Project to zip PPM files with multithreading
This project was in my undergrad OS class, where we needed to optimize a video zipping algorithm. My method used producer and consumer threads to acheive an execution time of 6 seconds, the fastest in the class. The project showcases OS, multithreading, and Linux fundementals.
